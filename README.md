## Structure
In `src/main` you may find source code. Classes listed there are not autogenerated. They describe file type (EOFileType), parser (EOParserDefinition), highlighting colors etc.

You also need to generate other classes depends on grammar. They should be generated from .g4 file and moved into 
`java/org/eolang/jetbrains/parser`

Repository doesn't contain grammar file. File will be downloaded automatically before 'build' gradle task
Grammar file should appear in `main/antlr/org/antlr/jetbrains/eo/parser`.
Then you should generate needed classes from downloaded grammar file. 
You may use `generateGrammarSource` gradle task or do it manually (EO.g4 -> right click -> generate ANTLR recognizer)

Resources (icons and plugin.xml) are located in `src/resources`.
