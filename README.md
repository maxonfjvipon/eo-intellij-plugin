# eo-intellij-plugin

This is Intellij plugin for **[EO language](https://github.com/objectionary/eo)**. Plugin is implemented on Java and ANTLR4 grammar.

 **[ANTLR 4 adapter](https://github.com/antlr/antlr4-intellij-adaptor)** was used for generating lexer and parser classes.
First version contains syntax highlighting

## Usage
Waiting for Jetbrains approving.
## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.
Please make sure to update tests as appropriate.

## Structure
In `src/main` you may find source code. Classes listed there are not autogenerated. They describe file type (EOFileType), parser (EOParserDefinition), highlighting colors etc.
Compiling will be failed if you forget to generate other classes. They should be generated from .g4 file and moved into 
`java/org/antlr/jetbrains/eo/parser`

Generating of needed classes is possible in grammar file (right click --> generate ANTLR recognizer)
`main/antlr/org/antlr/jetbrains/eo/parser` - grammar file.
Resources (icons and plugin.xml) are located in `src/resources`.
